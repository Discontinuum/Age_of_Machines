    description=_"This era's goal It is planned to transfer the world of Wesnoth into the distant future. It will have factions of all Wesnoth races.

Each faction in the era will have it's own race-specific ability and a super weapon. For example, orcs (or as they are formally called 'Demolishers') will have the 'Bloodthirst' race ability, and their super weapon shall be called 'lead rain'  

Bloodthirst - every next successful melee hit by an orc deals 1+(insert unit level here) more damage than the previous one. like 'growing fury' from Era of Magic.

The orcish super-weapon - Lead rain. It allows to bombard an area,
destroying anyone in a 3-tile radius.  

    
    Includes Demolishers, C.K.A. (Cosmic Knights Alliance)"

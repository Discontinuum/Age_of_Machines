Moreover, its value has even increased, as it is often the only artillery that nomads can use against enemy vehicles. With the help of demonic magic, zamburak can fire so fast that the enemy does not have time to respond. In large numbers, zamburak are a threat even to enemy units equipped with vehicles."

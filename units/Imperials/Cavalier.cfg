    description= _ "Before cavalry was a powerful striking force capable of turning the tide of battle, this role was now taken over by machines, and cavalrymen became support troops. As with infantry, the various cavalry units have been unified into dragoon regiments. Their tasks include reconnaissance, raiding sorties, and harassing retreating enemy infantry. The blue uniforms of dragoons became simpler and lost their former brightness, but even now they still have some decorations, referring to the glorious times of colorful and lucky cavalry. In addition to the uniform, a dragoon's equipment also includes a helmet with a mask, a sharp sword and a lightweight carbine. Although Dragoons are a far cry from the elite cavalry of the past, many wealthy Imperials prefer to serve as cavalrymen, so they retain a certain elitism and nobility."
